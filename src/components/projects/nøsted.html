        Programming Project with Nøsted &amp;
      </h3>

      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-white/90">
        (Aug 2023 – 2024)
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
        During my third semester at the University of Agder, I participated in a
        challenging programming project from Nøsted &amp;. Our task was to create an
        information system for the maintenance of winches. We designed a model for
        filling out service forms that employees or mechanics could complete, as
        well as checklists that needed to be ticked off.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
        All the form information was stored in a database using MariaDB. With this
        data, we were able to set up a service order overview. This allowed us to
        go back to the order, view the information added, and make changes as
        needed.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
        The project was developed using .NET &amp; C#, which required us to become
        familiar with these technologies. This provided us with valuable
        experience in using powerful tools for web development.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
        Additionally, we embraced the Azure DevOps methodology to optimize our
        human resources across various areas of the information system. We
        conducted daily Scrum stand-ups to keep everyone aligned and utilized the
        Azure DevOps Kanban board to efficiently track our progress and manage
        tasks.
      </p>

      <p class="text-sm text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
        I'm also happy to share that I got an A during this project. The images
        below provide a glimpse into the user interface of our application. They
        showcase the service form and checklist features, as well as the service
        order overview. Our goal was to create a user-friendly interface that made
        the maintenance process more efficient and manageable.
