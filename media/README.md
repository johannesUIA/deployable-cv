This folder is for media assets (images, icons) used by the site.

Guidance:
- Add your profile photos, screenshots and other images here.
- Use relative paths from the project root, e.g. `media/profile.jpg` and reference them in components or HTML.
- Keep files reasonably sized for web (optimized JPEG/WEBP/PNG).

Example:
<img src="/media/profile.jpg" alt="Profile photo" />
