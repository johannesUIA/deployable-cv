# Lage portofolio
Lage cv med portofolio. Tilslutt er ideen å ta i bruk  GitHub actions for å innøve CI/CL 

## Media and components

- Images and other media should go in the `media/` folder (there's a `media/README.md` with guidance).
- The large `index.html` has been split into small fragments under `src/components/` and are loaded at runtime by `src/component-loader.js`.
- To add or edit content, update the appropriate file in `src/components/` (for example `src/components/projects.html`) or replace the placeholder image(s) in `media/`.
